            ?</h2>
            <li><strong>ForEach:</strong> It is used when we need to execute a function for individual element of an
                array.
                It does not return a new array based on the given array.</li>
            <li><strong>Map:</strong> It is used to transform every element of an array by calling a function and return a new array with the elements in the same order as the original array. </li>
            <li><strong>Filter:</strong> It is used to return a new array with only the elements that meet the condition specified in a function.</li>
            <li><strong>Find:</strong>It is used to return the first element in the array that satisfies the specified condition. It returns null if no such element is found.</li>

            <p>The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Although JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, it gives us the feel of multi-threading.</p>
            <p>The <strong>call stack</strong> keeps track of all the operations in the line to be executed. When a function is done executing, it is popped from the stack.</p>
            <p>The <strong>event queue</strong> sends new functions to the stack for processing, It is like the queue data structure to maintain the sequential execution of the operations.</p>
            <p> Event loop allows JavaScript to handle multiple concurrent events efficiently, making it suitable for building responsive and interactive web applications.</p>
