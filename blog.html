        </h2>
        <li><strong>ForEach:</strong> It is used when we need to execute a function for individual element of an
            array.
            It does not return a new array based on the given array.</li>
        <li><strong>Map:</strong> It is used to transform every element of an array by calling a function and return a
            new array with the elements in the same order as the original array. </li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> It is used to return a new array with only the elements that meet the condition
            specified in a function.</li>
        <li><strong>Find:</strong>It is used to return the first element in the array that satisfies the specified
            condition. It returns null if no such element is found.</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">What is <strong>event loop</strong> and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Although JavaScript
            executes all operations on a single thread, it gives us the feel of multi-threading.</p>
        <p>The <strong>call stack</strong> keeps track of all the operations in the line to be executed. When a function
            is done executing, it is popped from the stack.</p>
        <p>The <strong>event queue</strong> sends new functions to the stack for processing, It is like the queue data
            structure to maintain the sequential execution of the operations.</p>
        <p> Event loop allows JavaScript to handle multiple concurrent events efficiently, making it suitable for
            building responsive and interactive web applications.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">What does the <strong><i>quizTimer()</i></strong> method do?</h2>
        <p>This function sets up a timer that counts from 0 and displays the elapsed time the element with with
            id="count". The timer is formatted to minutes and seconds.</p>
        <p>The function takes an argument "dismiss" and if it is true then it clears the interval timer with the
            clearInterval() function. It stops the timer when the quiz is over.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">What does the <strong><i>chooseQuiz()</i></strong> method do?
        </h2>
        <p>This function takes two arguments "index" and "givenAns"</p>
        <p>The function checks if there is an answer already for the current question or not. If there is, it updates
            the "givenAns" property, else it creates a new answer and saves it.</p>
        <p>It then calls another function displayAnswer() to display the current list of answers of the quiz.</p>
